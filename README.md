# Huffman Coding – Data Structures Project

This project implements the Huffman coding algorithm for text compression
using Java.

## Features
- Frequency analysis of characters
- Huffman tree construction using a priority queue
- Binary code generation
- Text encoding and decoding
- Compression rate calculation

## How to Run
1. Place your text in `input.txt`
2. Compile:
   javac huffman/*.java
3. Run:
   java huffman.Main

## Constraints
- No external Huffman libraries used
- Uses Java PriorityQueue
- Supports special characters
